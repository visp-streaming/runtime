# What is VISP?
VISP represents a set of different prototypes, which are designed to create an ecosystem for elastic stream processing applications, which consist of individual building blocks to ease the creation of new applications. Therefore, these prototypes cover all relevant lifecycle phases, ranging from the inventarization of the building blocks and the design of the application, over the deployment up to the usage monitoring and provisioning of computational resources to ensure a high level of quality of service.
